A Portrait of the **** as a Young ****
==========

Requires [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/). You also need a Twitter App access token, consumer key, and associated secrets: https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new

Finally, you need a Wordnik API key, which you can apply for here: http://developer.wordnik.com/

(You'll need to add all that info to config.js before running the program, otherwise Wordnik and Twitter won't play nice. Don't worry, it's all commented.)
